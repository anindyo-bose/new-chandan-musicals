    <h2>Who we Are</h2>
    <h3>New chandan musicals was established long way back in 1983 by Mr. Chandan Bose. At the beginning it was with a meager 30 sqft area facing H.B road, tharpakhna Ranchi 1. (Beside HOTEL SANJAY then, now SYNDICATE BANK BUILDING). Now the shop is slightly shifted inside that same lane, where we have expanded our old setup to 650 sq ft showroom and are operating it till date. It is mainly due to our perseverance with maintaining good quality with reasonable and justified price range which satisfied customers and bestowed their trust on us. We also do honour our valued customers with the kind patronage of everyone we could grow and now can boast to be the leading manufacturer/trader of Musical Instrument in Ranchi. </h3>
